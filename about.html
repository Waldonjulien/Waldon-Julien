      <h2> </h2>
      <p> On a day to day I enjoy cooking. From the stove to the grill I like to do it all. </p>

        <p>I enjoy gardening. There is something amazing about starting something from a seed and nurturing it until you can enjoy the benifits of your hardwork. </p>

        <p>I am also enjoy creativity and ideas. I enjoy 3d printing. A little gaming and spending time with family. </p>

        <p>I try my best to remain postive.
      It helps me keep a level head during the tough times  and even when things are going well. My aim is to find the best possible solution for a problem.   </p>
