      <h2> </h2>
      <p> Hello I am Waldon. I believe in doing things that give you purpose.
        What gives me purpose is my family. I am married and have a daughter who means the world to me.</p>

        <p>I enjoy gardening. There is something amazing about starting something from a seed and nurturing it until you can enjoy the benifits of your hardwork. </p>

        <p>I am also enjoy creativity and ideas. I enjoy 3d printing. Learning and figuring out ways to create the things that come to mind is a fun process. It does not always workout the first time, but nothing beats a failure but a try!</p>

        <p>I try my best to remain postive.
      It helps me keep a level head during the tough times in life and even when things are going well. My aim is to find the best possible solution for a problem.   </p>

      </p>
